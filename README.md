# oneliners
*Useful unix one-liners â€“ Battle Tested in Production :fire:*
## Linux commands
### pgrep
Kill all Java processes running under Hadoop user whose parent died.
```
$ pgrep -P 1 -u hadoop java | xargs sudo kill -TERM
```
Standard `ps -F --ppid 1 -C java -u hadoop` won't work in that case since it does **OR** filtering but but **AND**.

### netstat, lsof
Find out what process is holding the port 2181:
```
sudo netstat -ap | grep 2181
```
or, looks less verbose:
```
sudo lsof -i :2181
```

## Linux tools
### ack
[Ack](http://beyondgrep.com/) is awesome, single file in Perl (~4K lines).
Find all files under current dir with that name:
```
$ ack -g bazinga.jpg
```

Find imports of some `legacy_crap` in huge Python codebase:
```
$ ack --python '.*import.*legacy_crap.*'
```

### fzf
[Ffz](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf-bin/releases) is a fuzzy directory search. Useful for working with huge code repo,
like in most companies. Installs as a stand-alone binary with zere depedencies.
In a huge repository it's really useful to have the following shell alias in your `.bashrc`:
```
alias vzv='f=$(find . | fzf -e) && vim $f'
```
Using it you can always start from a root of a huge repo and avoid cd-ing into directories and hintting TAB key a lot.

### jq
[Jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) allows XPATH-style querying over `\n`-separated JSON. Super useful with other CLI tools that return JSON.
For example, get instances behind AWS ELBs:
```
$ aws --region us-west-2 elb describe-load-balancers | jq '.LoadBalancerDescriptions | .Instances'
```

### pkill
Always kill bash processed with `pkill -g` to send signal to the whole group, otherweise you may have processes called from shell still running.
```
$ pkill -INT -g 1234
```
